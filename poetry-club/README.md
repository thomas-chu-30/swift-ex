# The 1st Rule of Poetry Club

Welcome to The 1st Rule of Poetry Club on Exercism's Swift Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

## Importing

While Swift includes a lot of functionality in its Standard Library, there is much more functionality available in the form of external libraries.
These libraries may be from the Swift project itself, such as the [Swift Argument Parser][argument-parser], closed source libraries from companies Apple's [Network Framework][network-framework], or third-party libraries, like [Swifty Beaver][swifty-beaver].

Some of these modules, like the Network Framework or [Foundation][apple-foundation] (which is probably the most commonly used library in Swift) come with your Swift distribution.
External third party libraries need to be added to your project before they can be imported, though that is out of the scope of this exercise.

Importing modules is done by writing the `import` keyword followed by the name of the module. So one can import Foundation by adding the following to their program.

```swift
import Foundation
```

This allows access to all of the types, values, and functionality inside that module; for example if one wishes to use the `components(separatedBy:)` String method, that method becomes available to `String` with this import.

While they can be placed in the code anywhere before a pice of code that makes use of one the content of module, import statements are usually placed at the beginning of the file that uses them for greater readability.

## String indexing

Individual characters in a `String` can be accessed using the subscripting method used with arrays.
However, the [indices][string-indices] used for strings are _not_ integers and can not be worked with directly.
Instead they must be computed based off of some other known index, such as `startIndex`, which points to the position of the first character in a nonempty string, using the methods available in the [`String`][string-docs] and [`NSString`][nsstring-docs] libraries (when the `Foundation` module is imported, strings in Swift have access to all of the NSString properties and methods).

For example, given the following string:

```swift
let csv = "apple,pear,peach,orange,cherry,lime,goosberry"
```

One cannot write `csv[21]` to get the "g" in "orange", they must instead compute a value of type `String.Index` and supply that index instead.
Note that these indices are not meant to be human-consumable on their own.
They are what is referred to as _opaque indices_ ,as humans need not know what is inside them.

```swift
let index = csv.index(csv.startIndex, offsetBy: 21)
csv[index]
// "g"
print(index)
// prints Index(_rawBits: 1376513)
```

Note, however, that if the offset is not a valid index, i.e. if it would return the index before `startIndex` or after `endIndex` the operation will raise an error, crashing the program.
To prevent this problem, one can specify a limiting index.
This returns an optional index and it will return nil for otherwise invalid indices.

```swift
let tooFar = csv.index(csv.startIndex, offsetBy: 200)
// error: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP, subcode=0x0).
let tooFarButSafe = csv.index(csv.startIndex, offsetBy: 200, limitedBy: csv.endIndex)
// nil
```

Additionally, indices cannot be shared between strings.
For example, using the `index` of the "g" in "orange" computed above to index into the string `fam = "This is my family: üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶, this is our dog: üê∂, this is our cat: üê±!"`, i.e. `fam[index]` will crash your program.

There are many reasons for all of this, but they all basically boil down to "Unicode is tricky".

Generally speaking if you need random access to individual characters, you likely want to be using some other data structure, like `Array<Character>`.

### Some useful methods

Swift has the methods `first` and `last` to get the first and last character of a string.
These methods return an optional character, so if the string is empty, they will return nil.

```swift
let str = "Hello, world!"
print(str.first) // Prints Optional("H")
print(str.last)  // Prints Optional("!")
```

You can also use the `prefix` and `suffix` methods to get a substring of a string.
These methods take an integer as an argument and return a substring containing the first or last n characters of the string.

```swift
let str = "Hello, world!"
print(str.prefix(5)) // Prints "Hello"
print(str.suffix(6)) // Prints "world!"
```

## String methods

Working with string is a common task in programming.
Therefore Swift provides a variety of methods to manipulate strings.
This document will cover some of the most common string methods and properties, some of these require the import of the Foundation framework.

### [`components(separatedBy:)`][components]

When you want to split a string into an array of substrings, you can use the `components(separatedBy:)` method.
So say you would want to get every word in a sentence, you can use the space character as the separator.

```swift
let sentence = "Hello, world!"
let words = sentence.components(separatedBy: " ")
print(words) // Prints ["Hello,", "world!"]
```

### [`hasPrefix(_:)`][hasPrefix], [`hasSuffix(_:)`][hasSuffix]

When you want to check if a string starts or ends with a certain substring, you can use the `hasPrefix(_:)` and `hasSuffix(_:)` methods.
Both of these methods take a string as an argument and return a boolean value indicating whether the string starts or ends with the specified substring.

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, world!"
print(greeting.hasPrefix("Hello"))  // Prints true
print(greeting.hasSuffix("world!")) // Prints true
```

### [`lowercased`][lowercased], [`uppercased`][uppercased], [`capitalized`][capitalized]

When you want to change the case of a string, you can use the `lowercased`, `uppercased`, and `capitalized` properties.
The `lowercased` property returns a new string with all characters in lowercase, the `uppercased` property returns a new string with all characters in uppercase, and the `capitalized` property returns a new string with the first character of each word capitalized.

```swift
let greeting = "hello, world!"
print(greeting.lowercased)  // Prints "hello, world!"
print(greeting.uppercased)  // Prints "HELLO, WORLD!"
print(greeting.capitalized) // Prints "Hello, World!"
```

### [`replacingOccurrences(of:with:)`][replacingOccurrences]

When you want to replace all occurrences of a substring in a string with another substring, you can use the `replacingOccurrences(of:with:)` method.
This method takes two strings as arguments: the substring to be replaced and the substring to replace it with. It returns a new string with all occurrences of the specified substring replaced.

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, world!"
let newGreeting = greeting.replacingOccurrences(of: "world", with: "Swift")
print(newGreeting) // Prints "Hello, Swift!"
```

### [`joined(separator:)`][joined]

This isn't a method of the String type, but rather of the Array type.
When you want to join an array of strings into a single string with a specified separator, you can use the `joined(separator:)` method.
This method takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with all elements of the array joined together, separated by the specified string.

```swift
let words = ["Hello", "world"]
let sentence = words.joined(separator: ", ")
print(sentence) // Prints "Hello, world"
```

## Instructions

A new poetry club has opened in town, and you're thinking of attending.
Because there have been incidents in the past, the club has a very specific door policy which you'll need to master, before attempting entry.

There are two doors at the poetry club, both are guarded.
In order to gain entry, you'll need to work out the password of that day:

## 1. Split a string into individual lines

The first thing you need to do is split the poem into individual lines.
The guard will recite a poem, and you will have to split it into lines.

Implement the function `splitOnNewlines` that takes a string and splits it into an array of strings, using the newline character as the delimiter.
The function should return an array of strings, where each string is a line from the poem.

```swift
splitOnNewlines("Hello.\nHow are you?\n\nI'm doing fine.")
// returns ["Hello." ,"How are you?", "", "I'm doing fine"].
```

## 2. Front door

1. The guard will recite a poem
2. You will have to split the poem into individual lines.
3. You will have to get the first letter of each line.
4. You will have to ensable the letters, which will form a word.

For example, one of their favorite writers is Michael Lockwood, who's written the following _acrostic_ poem, which means that the first letter of each sentence form a word:

```text
Stands so high
Huge hooves too
Impatiently waits for
Reins and harness
Eager to leave
```

When the guard recites the poem, you will split it into individual lines and respond with the first letters of each line, i.e. `["S", "H", "I", "R", "E"]`.

The guard will then give you the word formed by the array of letters you replied with for you to put into capitalized word form.
Finally the password you return is `"SHIRE"`, and you'll get in.

Implement the function `frontDoorPassword` that takes a string which represents the poem.
The function should return the password that you would give to the guard.

```swift
frontDoorPassword("Stands so high\nHuge hooves too\nImpatiently waits for\nReins and harness\nEager to leave")
// returns "SHIRE"
```

## 3. Back door

In the back of the club you'll find the most renowned poets, which is like the VIP area.
Because this is not for everyone, the back door process is a bit more convoluted.

1. The guard will recite a poem.
2. You will have to split the poem into lines.
3. You will have to get the last letter of each line.
   - The line will sometimes have trailing spaces, so you will need to strip them off.
4. You will have to assemble the letters and then add `", please."` to the end of the word formed by the letters.

For example, the poem mentioned before is also _telestich_, which means that the last letter of each sentence form a word:

```text
Stands so high
Huge hooves too
Impatiently waits for
Reins and harness
Eager to leave
```

When the guard recites the poem, you will split it into individual lines, strip off any trailing spaces, and respond with the first letters of each line, i.e. `["h", "o", "r", "s", "e"]`.

The guard will then give you the word formed by the array of letters you replied with for you to put into capitalized word form and append `", please."`.
Finally the password you return is `"horse, please."`, and you'll get in.

Implement the function `backDoorPassword` that takes a string which represents the poem.
The function should return the password that you would give to the guard.

```swift
backDoorPassword("Stands so high\nHuge hooves too\nImpatiently waits for\nReins and harness\nEager to leave")
// returns "horse, please."
```

## 4. Secret room

Inside the back room of the club is another door that leads to the secret room that only the very top poets may enter.

1. The guard will recite a poem.
2. You will have to split the poem into lines.
3. You will have to get the i<sup>th</sup> letter of the i<sup>th</sup> line. 
4. You will have to assemble the letters and then add `"!"` to the end of the word formed by the letters.
5. You will have to put the word in uppercased form.

For example, a modified version of the poem mentioned before fits this pattern:

```text
Stands so high
Huge hooves too
Impatiently waits for
Rider with harness
Eager to leave
```

When the guard recites the poem, you will split it into individual lines, strip off any trailing spaces, and respond with the i<sup>th</sup> letters of each line, i.e. ["S", "u", "p", "e", "r"].

The guard will then give you the word formed by the array of letters you replied with for you to put into uppercased word form and append `"!"`.
Finally the password you return is `SUPER!`, and you'll get in.

Implement the function `secretRoomPassword` that takes a string which represents the poem.
The function should return the password that you would give to the guard.

```swift
secretRoomPassword("Stands so high\nHuge hooves too\nImpatiently waits for\nRider with harness\nEager to leave")
// returns "SUPER!"
```
